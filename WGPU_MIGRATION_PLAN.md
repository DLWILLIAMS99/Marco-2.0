# Marco 2.0 WGPU Migration Plan

## Phase 1: Core Logic Preservation (Keep These)

### âœ… Preserve Existing Core Systems
These systems are platform-agnostic and should be kept:

```
src/core/                   # Complete preservation
â”œâ”€â”€ types/                  # MetaValue, DotPath, ScopeId
â”œâ”€â”€ registry/               # MetaRegistry with scoped access
â”œâ”€â”€ logic/                  # Node system, expression evaluation
â””â”€â”€ events/                 # Event system

src/graph/                  # Complete preservation
â”œâ”€â”€ runtime/                # Graph execution engine
â””â”€â”€ scope/                  # Scope management

src/project/                # Complete preservation
â”œâ”€â”€ template/               # Template system
â””â”€â”€ loader/                 # Project serialization
```

### âœ… Preserve Business Logic
- All node types (Add, Multiply, Constant, etc.)
- Property binding system
- Expression evaluation
- Registry operations
- Graph execution

## Phase 2: New WGPU Foundation

### ðŸ”„ Complete Rebuild Required
```
src/ui/ â†’ src/renderer/     # Completely new WGPU-based system
â”œâ”€â”€ wgpu_context.rs         # Device, queue, surface management
â”œâ”€â”€ shaders/                # WGSL shader library
â”œâ”€â”€ primitives/             # GPU-accelerated shape rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ text/                   # Advanced text rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ canvas/                 # Professional canvas with layers
â”œâ”€â”€ nodes/                  # GPU-accelerated node rendering
â””â”€â”€ platform/               # Web, desktop, mobile abstractions
```

### ðŸ†• New Capabilities Unlocked
- **Cross-Platform Targets**: Web (WASM), Desktop (native), Mobile (future)
- **Professional Graphics**: Hardware-accelerated bezier curves, gradients, shadows
- **Advanced Text**: Rich typography, text on paths, advanced layouts
- **Real-time Effects**: Blur, glow, particle systems, animations
- **Performance**: Handle 10,000+ elements smoothly
- **Custom UI**: Design system matches target platform conventions

## Phase 3: Implementation Approach

### Step 1: New Cargo.toml with WGPU Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
# Core logic (preserve)
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }

# WGPU rendering stack
wgpu = "0.19"
winit = "0.29"
pollster = "0.3"
bytemuck = { version = "1.14", features = ["derive"] }
glam = "0.25"  # Math library for 3D transforms

# Advanced text rendering
cosmic-text = "0.10"  # Modern text shaping and layout
fontdue = "0.8"       # Font rasterization

# Platform-specific
[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
web-sys = "0.3"
js-sys = "0.3"

# Asset loading and image processing
image = "0.24"
```

### Step 2: Core Architecture
```rust
// New main architecture
pub struct Marco2App {
    // Preserve core logic
    registry: Arc<MetaRegistry>,
    graph_runtime: GraphRuntime,
    
    // New WGPU renderer
    renderer: Marco2Renderer,
    
    // Mode-specific canvases
    logic_canvas: LogicCanvas,
    gui_canvas: GuiCanvas,
    
    // Cross-platform event handling
    platform: PlatformAdapter,
}

pub struct Marco2Renderer {
    device: wgpu::Device,
    queue: wgpu::Queue,
    surface: wgpu::Surface,
    
    // Rendering pipelines
    shape_pipeline: ShapeRenderPipeline,
    text_pipeline: TextRenderPipeline,
    node_pipeline: NodeRenderPipeline,
    effect_pipeline: EffectRenderPipeline,
}
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Targets

#### Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
```rust
// src/main_desktop.rs
fn main() {
    let event_loop = EventLoop::new();
    let window = WindowBuilder::new()
        .with_title("Marco 2.0")
        .with_inner_size(LogicalSize::new(1200, 800))
        .build(&event_loop)
        .unwrap();
    
    let mut app = Marco2App::new_desktop(window);
    
    event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
        app.handle_event(event, control_flow);
    });
}
```

#### Web (WASM)
```rust
// src/main_web.rs
#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub fn main() {
    console_log::init().expect("Initialize logger");
    
    let event_loop = EventLoop::new();
    let window = web_sys::window()
        .and_then(|win| win.document())
        .and_then(|doc| doc.get_element_by_id("marco2-canvas"))
        .expect("Canvas element not found");
    
    let window = WindowBuilder::new()
        .with_canvas(Some(window.into()))
        .build(&event_loop)
        .unwrap();
    
    let mut app = Marco2App::new_web(window);
    
    event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
        app.handle_event(event, control_flow);
    });
}
```

#### Mobile (Future)
```rust
// src/main_mobile.rs - Future implementation
// Will use same core with mobile-optimized UI
```

## Migration Decision

Given your vision of enabling non-programmers to create sophisticated applications without platform limitations, I strongly recommend the **clean slate approach** with careful preservation of your core logic systems.

This approach will:
1. âœ… Preserve all your valuable business logic
2. âœ… Unlock professional-grade design capabilities
3. âœ… Enable true cross-platform deployment
4. âœ… Future-proof the architecture
5. âœ… Provide a foundation for unlimited creative potential

Would you like me to start implementing this migration plan? I can begin with the new Cargo.toml and basic WGPU foundation while ensuring all your core logic systems are preserved and enhanced.
