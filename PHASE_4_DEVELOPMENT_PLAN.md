```rust
// Responsive design system
pub struct ResponsiveLayout {
    breakpoints: HashMap<String, LayoutBreakpoint>,
    current_size: ScreenSize,
    adaptive_components: Vec<AdaptiveComponent>,
}

// Touch input handling
pub struct TouchHandler {
    active_touches: HashMap<TouchId, TouchState>,
    gesture_recognizer: GestureRecognizer,
    touch_tools: TouchToolSet,
}

// Web assembly integration
pub struct WebAssemblyRuntime {
    canvas_context: WebCanvasContext,
    web_storage: WebStorageAdapter,
    browser_apis: BrowserIntegration,
}
```

### 🎨 Animation System Architecture
```rust
// Animation framework
pub struct AnimationEngine {
    timeline: AnimationTimeline,
    keyframes: HashMap<ElementId, Vec<Keyframe>>,
    easing_functions: EasingLibrary,
    active_animations: Vec<ActiveAnimation>,
}

// Keyframe system
pub struct Keyframe {
    timestamp: f64,
    properties: HashMap<String, AnimatedValue>,
    easing: EasingFunction,
}
```

### 🧩 Component System Architecture
```rust
// Component library
pub struct ComponentLibrary {
    templates: HashMap<ComponentId, ComponentTemplate>,
    categories: Vec<ComponentCategory>,
    marketplace: ComponentMarketplace,
}

// Reusable components
pub struct ComponentTemplate {
    id: ComponentId,
    name: String,
    elements: Vec<GuiElement>,
    properties: Vec<ComponentProperty>,
    preview: ComponentPreview,
}
```
